                <p>Here we have listed some of the students who are studying at the university who have a lot of experience in many fields, including the Department of Science, including marine science, mineral science and many others that cannot be summarized here. The university also offers more than internships and a place to showcase skills and international trainings that it organizes in different countries where students graduate, unlike students from universities around the world. That's what we bring together here..</p>
